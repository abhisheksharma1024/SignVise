# TEAM PRAGYAAN

# SignVise- Integrated ML Framework for Gesture-Driven Text, Control & Safety and Gamified Learning

# PROBLEM STATEMENT- 
> Emergency situations often prevent manual device interaction
> Existing systems lack automated gesture-based detection
> Abscence of real time location and visual context delays response
> Need for a low latency, hands free AI emergency alert mechanism

# DESCRIPTION & SOLUTION-
> Developed an ML based HAND LANDMARK RECOGNITION in real time utilizing MEDIAPIPE
> Implements OPENCV for video frame processing and gesture duration tracking
> Developed an ML based EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM using computer vision techniques
> Triggers emergency response upon sustained detection of predefined gestures
> Integrates TWILIO API for automated SMS delivery thorugh real time GEOLOCATION tracking in distress situations
> Developed an GESTURE BASED CURSOR MOVEMENT module for differently abled & bed ridden people
> Designed GAMIFIED LEARNING EXPERIENCE for Gesture Recognition
> Built using PYTHON ensuring modularity & scalability

# INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN PROJECT CODE
> Open Repository SignVise
> Go to Pragyaan Folder and the codes and assets will appear
> Locate main.py file which contains final run code
> Run the code but remember to download all the assets in the folder locally
